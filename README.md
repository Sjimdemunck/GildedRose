Did some rework on the Gilded rose logic.

I wanted to update the Items based on their types, so a switch statement would make sense to me.
Used const[] for cleanliness of the types.

Reworking the `ifs` hell was fun to do and couldn't quite get the hang of it in the first place.
Like there was said: once you're done it's not that hard actually.

there is no default case in the switch statement, since default is the generic item (common items if u will).

Setting this up like it is now, makes sense to me. I'd love to get some feedback/pointers!
